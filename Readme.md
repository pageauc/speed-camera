# SPEED CAMERA - Object Motion Tracker [![Mentioned in Awesome <INSERT LIST NAME>](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/thibmaek/awesome-raspberry-pi)
### RPI, Unix and Windows Speed Camera Using python, openCV, RPI camera module, USB Cam or IP Cam
## For Details See [Program Features](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/Program-Description#program-features), [Wiki Instructions](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki) and [YouTube Videos](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera#reference-links).

## RPI Quick curl Install or Upgrade   
***IMPORTANT*** - A raspbian **sudo apt-get update** and **sudo apt-get upgrade** will
**NOT** be performed as part of   
**speed-install.sh** so it is recommended you run these prior to install
to ensure your system is up-to-date.     

***Step 1*** With mouse left button highlight curl command in code box below. Right click mouse in **highlighted** area and Copy.     
***Step 2*** On RPI putty SSH or terminal session right click, select paste then Enter to download and run script.  

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/master/speed-install.sh | bash

This will download and run the **speed-install.sh** script. If running under python3 you will need opencv3 installed.
See my Github [menu driven compile opencv3 from source](https://github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup) project

***IMPORTANT*** speed-cam.py ver 8.x or greater Requires Updated config.py and plugins.

    cd ~/speed-camera
    cp config.py config.py.bak
    cp config.py.new config.py
    
To replace plugins rename (or delete) plugins folder per below

    cd ~/speed-camera
    mv plugins pluginsold   # renames plugins folder
    rm -r plugins           # deletes plugins folder

Then run ***menubox.sh*** UPGRADE menu pick.

## Program Description   
This is a raspberry pi, Windows, Unix Distro computer openCV object speed camera demo program.
It is written in python and uses openCV to detect and track the x,y coordinates of the 
largest moving object in the camera view above a minimum pixel area.

User variables are stored in the [***config.py***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/blob/master/config.py) file.
Motion detection is restricted between ***y_upper***, ***y_lower***, ***x_left***, ***x_right*** variables  (road or area of interest).
Auto calculated but can be overridden in config.py by uncommenting desired variable settings.
Motion Tracking is controlled by the ***track_counter*** variable in config.py.  This sets the number of track events and 
the track length in pixels.  This may need to be tuned for camera view, cpu speed, etc. 
Speed is calculated based on ***cal_obj_px*** and ***cal_obj_mm*** variables for L2R and R2L motion direction. A video stream frame image will be
captured and saved in ***media/images*** dated subfolders (optional) per variable ***imageSubDirMaxFiles*** = ***2000*** 
For variable settings details see [config.py file](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/blob/master/config.py). 

If ***log_data_to_CSV*** = ***True*** then a ***speed-cam.csv*** file will be created/updated with event data stored in
CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This can be imported into a spreadsheet, database, Etc program for further processing.
Release 8.9 adds a **sqlite3** database to store speed data. Default is ***data/speed_cam.db*** with data in the ***speed*** table.
Database setting can be managed from config.py.  Database is automatically created from config.py settings. For more
details see [How to Manage Sqlite3 Database](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/How-to-Manage-Sqlite3-Database)

Can accept parameters or will prompt user if run from console with no parameters
* [***makehtml.py***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/How-to-View-Data#view-combined-imagedata-html-pages-on-a-web-browser)
Creates html files that combine csv and image data for easier viewing from a web browser and saved to media/html folder.    
* [***speed-search.py***](https://github.com/pageauc/rpi-speed-camera/wiki/How-to-Run-speed-search.py)
allows searching for similar target object images using opencv template matching.  Results save to media/search folder.    
* [***alpr-speed.py***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/alpr-speed.py---Process-speed-images-with-OPENALPR-Automatic-License-Plate-Reader)
This is a demo that processes existing speed camera images with a front or back view of vehicle using [OPENALPR](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr)
License plate reader. Output is saved to media/alpr folder. For installation, Settings and Run details see
[ALPR Wiki Documentaion](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/alpr-speed.py---Process-speed-images-with-OPENALPR-Automatic-License-Plate-Reader)

## Requirements
[***Raspberry Pi computer***](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/setup/) and a [***RPI camera module installed***](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/)
or USB Camera plugged in. Make sure hardware is tested and works. Most [RPI models](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) will work OK. 
A quad core RPI will greatly improve performance due to threading. A recent version of 
[Raspbian operating system](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) is Recommended.   
or  
***MS Windows or Unix distro*** computer with a USB Web Camera plugged in and a
[recent version of python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
For Details See [***Wiki details***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/Prerequisites-and-Install#windows-or-non-rpi-unix-installs).

It is recommended you upgrade to OpenCV version 3.x.x  For Easy compile of opencv 3.4.2 from source 
See https://github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup

## Windows or Non RPI Unix Installs
For Windows or Unix computer platforms (non RPI or Debian) ensure you have the most
up-to-date python version. For Downloads visit https://www.python.org/downloads    

The latest python versions includes numpy and recent opencv version that is required to run this code. 
You will also need a USB web cam installed and working. 
To install this program access the GitHub project page at https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera
Select the ***green Clone or download*** button. The files will be cloned or zipped
to a speed-camera folder. You can run the code from python IDLE application (recommended), GUI desktop
or command prompt terminal window. Note bash .sh shell scripts will not work with windows unless 
special support for bash is installed for windows Eg http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/  http://www.cygwin.com/
Note I have Not tested these.   

## Docker Install Quick Start
speed camera supports a docker installation per the following

1. If you haven't already, [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
1. Clone the repository
1. Run `docker-compose up` from the directory you cloned the repo into.
1. The Docker container will likely exit because it is using a default config.
1. Edit the configuration file @ `config/config.py`
1. Run `docker-compose up`
 
## Manual Install or Upgrade   
From logged in RPI SSH session or console terminal perform the following. Allows you to review install code before running

    cd ~
    wget https://raw.github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/master/speed-install.sh
    more speed-install.sh       # You can review code if you wish
    chmod +x speed-install.sh
    ./speed-install.sh  # runs install script.
    
## Run to view verbose logging 

    cd ~/speed-camera    
    ./speed-cam.py
    
See [***How to Run***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/How-to-Run) speed-cam.py wiki section

***IMPORTANT*** Speed Camera will start in ***calibrate*** = ***True*** Mode.    
Review settings in ***config.py*** file and edit variables with nano as required.
You will need to perform a calibration to set the correct value for config.py ***cal_obj_px*** and ***cal_obj_mm*** for
L2R and R2L directions. The variables are based on the distance from camera to objects being measured for speed.
See [***Calibration Procedure***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/Calibrate-Camera-for-Distance) for more details.     

The config.py motion tracking variable called ***track_counter*** = can be adjusted for your system and opencv version.
Default is 5 but a quad core RPI3 and latest opencv version eg 3.4.2 can be 10-15 or possibly greater.  This will
require monitoring the verbose log messages in order to fine tune.
    
## Run menubox.sh 

    cd ~/speed-camera
    ./menubox.sh

Admin speed-cam Easier using menubox.sh (Once calibrated and/or testing complete)  
![menubox main menu](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/blob/master/menubox.png)     

View speed-cam data and trends from web browser per sample screen shots. These can be generated 
from Menubox.sh menu pick or by running scripts from console or via crontab schedule.
